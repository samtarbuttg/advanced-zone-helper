## 1. Polygon Representation

A polygon $P$ is represented as an ordered sequence of $n$ vertices:

$$
P = \{(x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_{n-1}, y_{n-1})\}
$$

For a closed polygon, we define $P_n = P_0$ (the last vertex connects back to the first).

**Curve Primitives:** The algorithm handles various geometric primitives which are discretized into point sequences:
- **Line Segments**: Direct vertex-to-vertex connections
- **Arcs**: Approximated using angular subdivision
- **Circles**: Discretized into $n$ equidistant points around the circumference
- **Bézier Curves**: Sampled using De Casteljau's algorithm

---

## 2. Signed Area and Winding Direction (Shoelace Formula)

### 2.1 The Shoelace Formula

The **signed area** of a simple polygon $P$ with vertices $(x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_{n-1}, y_{n-1})$ is computed using the Shoelace formula (also known as Gauss's area formula):

$$
A_{signed} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} \begin{vmatrix} x_i & x_{i+1} \\ y_i & y_{i+1} \end{vmatrix} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (x_i \cdot y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} \cdot y_i)
$$

where indices are taken modulo $n$ (i.e., $(x_n, y_n) = (x_0, y_0)$).

### 2.2 Derivation

The formula derives from **Green's theorem** applied to the area integral. For a region $D$ bounded by curve $C$:

$$
\iint_D dA = \oint_C x \, dy = -\oint_C y \, dx
$$

Using the symmetric form:

$$
A = \frac{1}{2} \oint_C (x \, dy - y \, dx)
$$

For a polygon with straight edges, this integral becomes a sum over line segments, yielding the Shoelace formula.

### 2.3 Winding Direction

The **sign** of $A_{signed}$ determines the winding direction:

| Sign of $A_{signed}$ | Winding Direction |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| $A_{signed} > 0$ | **Counter-clockwise (CCW)** - Exterior boundary |
| $A_{signed} < 0$ | **Clockwise (CW)** - Hole boundary |

This property is fundamental for distinguishing outer boundaries from holes in complex shapes.

### 2.4 Implementation

```
function polygon_area(P):
    n = length(P)
    area = 0
    for i = 0 to n-2:
        j = (i + 1) mod n
        area += P[i].x * P[j].y
        area -= P[j].x * P[i].y
    return |area| / 2
```

**Note:** The implementation returns `|area|` (absolute value) for area calculations, but the sign can be preserved for winding direction determination.

## 3. Point-in-Polygon Test (Ray Casting Algorithm)

### 3.1 Algorithm Overview

The **Ray Casting Algorithm** (also called the **Crossing Number** or **Even-Odd Rule**) determines whether a point $Q = (x_q, y_q)$ lies inside a polygon $P$.

### 3.2 Mathematical Foundation

Cast a ray from point $Q$ in any direction (typically along the positive x-axis: $y = y_q, x > x_q$). Count the number of times this ray crosses the polygon boundary.

**Decision Rule:**

$$
\text{Point } Q \text{ is inside } P \iff \text{crossing count is odd}
$$

This follows from the **Jordan Curve Theorem**: any simple closed curve divides the plane into exactly two regions (inside and outside), and any path from inside to outside must cross the boundary.

### 3.3 Edge Crossing Test

For an edge from $(x_i, y_i)$ to $(x_j, y_j)$, the ray $y = y_q$ crosses this edge if:

1. **Vertical span condition**: The edge straddles the ray's y-coordinate:
   $$
   (y_i > y_q) \neq (y_j > y_q)
   $$

2. **Intersection point**: The x-coordinate of intersection is:
   $$
   x_{intersect} = x_i + \frac{(y_q - y_i)(x_j - x_i)}{y_j - y_i}
   $$

3. **Ray direction**: The intersection is to the right of $Q$:
   $$
   x_q < x_{intersect}
   $$

### 3.4 Implementation

```
function point_in_polygon(Q, P):
    x, y = Q
    n = length(P)
    inside = false
    j = n - 1
    
    for i = 0 to n-1:
        xi, yi = P[i]
        xj, yj = P[j]
        
        if ((yi > y) ≠ (yj > y)) and 
           (x < (xj - xi) * (y - yi) / (yj - yi) + xi):
            inside = ¬inside
        
        j = i
    
    return inside
```

### 3.5 Complexity

- **Time**: $O(n)$ for a polygon with $n$ vertices
- **Space**: $O(1)$ additional space

---

## 4. Polygon Containment Detection

### 4.1 Definition

Polygon $P_{inner}$ is **contained within** polygon $P_{outer}$ if:

$$
\forall \, p \in P_{inner} : p \in \text{interior}(P_{outer})
$$

### 4.2 Practical Test

The algorithm verifies containment by checking that **all vertices** of $P_{inner}$ lie inside $P_{outer}$:

$$
\text{contains}(P_{outer}, P_{inner}) = \bigwedge_{i=0}^{m-1} \text{point\_in\_polygon}(P_{inner}[i], P_{outer})
$$

where $m$ is the number of vertices in $P_{inner}$.

### 4.3 Area Ratio Filtering

To prevent false positives from nearly-identical polygons (due to numerical precision), an **area ratio test** is applied:

$$
r = \frac{A(P_{inner})}{A(P_{outer})}
$$

If $r > 0.99$, the polygons are considered identical and containment is rejected:

$$
\text{valid\_containment} = \text{all\_points\_inside} \land (r \leq 0.99)
$$

---

## 5. Containment Graph Construction

### 5.1 Graph Definition

Given a set of $n$ polygons $\{P_0, P_1, \ldots, P_{n-1}\}$, we construct a **directed containment graph** $G = (V, E)$ where:

- **Vertices**: $V = \{0, 1, \ldots, n-1\}$ (polygon indices)
- **Edges**: $(i, j) \in E \iff P_i \text{ contains } P_j$

### 5.2 Adjacency List Representation

The graph is stored as an adjacency list:

$$
\text{containment}[i] = \{j \mid P_i \text{ contains } P_j\}
$$

### 5.3 Construction Algorithm

```
function build_containment_graph(polygons):
    n = length(polygons)
    containment = [[] for i in range(n)]
    
    for i = 0 to n-1:
        for j = 0 to n-1:
            if i ≠ j and polygon_contains_polygon(polygons[i], polygons[j]):
                containment[i].append(j)
    
    return containment
```

### 5.4 Complexity

- **Time**: $O(n^2 \cdot m)$ where $n$ is the number of polygons and $m$ is the average vertex count
- This pairwise comparison is necessary to establish all containment relationships

---

## 6. Direct Containment and Hole Detection

### 6.1 Direct vs. Indirect Containment

A polygon $P_j$ is a **direct child** (immediate hole) of $P_i$ if:

1. $P_i$ contains $P_j$
2. There is no intermediate polygon $P_k$ such that $P_i$ contains $P_k$ and $P_k$ contains $P_j$

Formally:

$$
\text{direct\_child}(i, j) = (j \in \text{containment}[i]) \land \neg \exists k : (k \in \text{containment}[i]) \land (j \in \text{containment}[k])
$$

### 6.2 Transitivity Elimination

The containment relation is **transitive**: if $A$ contains $B$ and $B$ contains $C$, then $A$ contains $C$. The algorithm filters out transitive relationships to find only direct parent-child pairs.

### 6.3 Algorithm

```
function find_direct_children(containment):
    n = length(containment)
    direct_children = [[] for i in range(n)]
    
    for i = 0 to n-1:
        for j in containment[i]:
            if is_direct_containment(i, j, containment):
                direct_children[i].append(j)
    
    return direct_children

function is_direct_containment(outer, inner, containment):
    for k in containment[outer]:
        if k ≠ inner and inner in containment[k]:
            return false  # Found intermediate polygon
    return true
```

### 6.4 Resulting Hierarchy

This produces a **tree structure** where:
- **Root nodes**: Outermost polygons (contained by nothing)
- **Children**: Polygons directly inside their parent
- **Depth**: Alternates between boundary (even depth) and hole (odd depth)

---

## 7. Zone Classification

Based on the direct children relationships, polygons are classified into zone types:

### 7.1 Classification Rules

| Direct Children Count | Zone Type | Description |
|----------------------|-----------|-------------|
| 0 | **Simple Zone** | Solid region with no holes |
| 1 | **Ring Zone** | Annular region (1 outer, 1 inner boundary) |
| $\geq 2$ | **Multi-Hole Zone** | Region with multiple holes |

### 7.2 Formal Definition

Let $C(i) = \text{direct\_children}[i]$:

$$
\text{zone\_type}(P_i) = \begin{cases}
\text{Simple} & \text{if } |C(i)| = 0 \\
\text{Ring} & \text{if } |C(i)| = 1 \\
\text{MultiHole} & \text{if } |C(i)| \geq 2
\end{cases}
$$

---

## 8. Ring and Multi-Hole Area Calculation

### 8.1 Ring Zone Area

For a ring zone with outer boundary $P_{outer}$ and inner boundary $P_{inner}$:

$$
A_{ring} = A(P_{outer}) - A(P_{inner})
$$

### 8.2 Multi-Hole Zone Area

For a zone with outer boundary $P_{outer}$ and $k$ holes $\{H_1, H_2, \ldots, H_k\}$:

$$
A_{multi} = A(P_{outer}) - \sum_{i=1}^{k} A(H_i)
$$

### 8.3 General Formula (Signed Area Approach)

Using the winding direction convention where:
- Outer boundaries have positive (CCW) winding
- Hole boundaries have negative (CW) winding

The total area can be computed as:

$$
A_{total} = \sum_{i} A_{signed}(P_i)
$$

where polygons with CCW winding contribute positively and CW polygons subtract their area.
