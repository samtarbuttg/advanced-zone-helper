# Mathematical Foundation of Multi-Hole Polygon Detection Algorithm

This document explains the algorithms used for detecting and classifying polygon zones, including winding direction and multi-hole shape detection.

## 1. Polygon Representation

A polygon $P$ is represented as an ordered sequence of $n$ vertices:

```math
P = \{(x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_{n-1}, y_{n-1})\}
```

For a closed polygon, we define $`P_n = P_0`$ (the last vertex connects back to the first).

**Curve Primitives:** The algorithm handles various geometric primitives which are discretized into point sequences:
- **Line Segments**: Direct vertex-to-vertex connections
- **Arcs**: Approximated using angular subdivision
- **Circles**: Discretized into $n$ equidistant points around the circumference
- **Bézier Curves**: Sampled using De Casteljau's algorithm

## 2. Signed Area and Winding Direction (Shoelace Formula)

### 2.1 The Shoelace Formula

The **signed area** of a simple polygon $P$ with vertices $`(x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_1), \ldots, (x_{n-1}, y_{n-1})`$ is computed using the Shoelace formula (also known as Gauss's area formula). We call it "signed" because the result can be positive or negative depending on whether vertices are ordered counter-clockwise or clockwise—this sign encodes the winding direction.

```math
A_{signed} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (x_i \cdot y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} \cdot y_i)
```

This is the **cross product** of consecutive position vectors, equivalent to the 2×2 determinant:

```math
\begin{vmatrix} x_i & x_{i+1} \\\ y_i & y_{i+1} \end{vmatrix} = x_i \cdot y_{i+1} - x_{i+1} \cdot y_i
```

where indices are taken modulo $n$ (i.e., $`(x_n, y_n) = (x_0, y_0)`$).

### 2.2 Winding Direction

The **sign** of $`A_{signed}`$ determines the winding direction:

| Sign of $`A_{signed}`$ | Winding Direction |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| $`A_{signed} > 0`$ | **Counter-clockwise (CCW)** - Exterior boundary |
| $`A_{signed} < 0`$ | **Clockwise (CW)** - Hole boundary |

This property is fundamental for distinguishing outer boundaries from holes in complex shapes.

### 2.3 Implementation

```
function polygon_area(P):
    n = length(P)
    area = 0
    for i = 0 to n-2:
        j = (i + 1) mod n
        area += P[i].x * P[j].y
        area -= P[j].x * P[i].y
    return |area| / 2
```

**Note:** The implementation returns `|area|` (absolute value) for area calculations, but the sign can be preserved for winding direction determination.

## 3. Point-in-Polygon Test (Ray Casting Algorithm)

The **Ray Casting Algorithm** determines whether a point $`Q = (x_q, y_q)`$ lies inside a polygon $P$.

Cast a ray from $Q$ along the positive x-axis and count how many times it crosses the polygon boundary. If the count is **odd**, the point is inside; if **even**, it's outside.

### 3.1 Edge Crossing Test

For an edge from $`(x_i, y_i)`$ to $`(x_j, y_j)`$, the ray $`y = y_q`$ crosses this edge if:

1. **Vertical span condition**: The edge straddles the ray's y-coordinate: $`(y_i > y_q) \neq (y_j > y_q)`$

2. **Intersection point**: The x-coordinate of intersection is: $`x_{intersect} = x_i + \frac{(y_q - y_i)(x_j - x_i)}{y_j - y_i}`$

3. **Ray direction**: The intersection is to the right of $Q$: $`x_q < x_{intersect}`$

### 3.2 Implementation

```
function point_in_polygon(Q, P):
    x, y = Q
    n = length(P)
    inside = false
    j = n - 1
    
    for i = 0 to n-1:
        xi, yi = P[i]
        xj, yj = P[j]
        
        if ((yi > y) ≠ (yj > y)) and 
           (x < (xj - xi) * (y - yi) / (yj - yi) + xi):
            inside = ¬inside
        
        j = i
    
    return inside
```

## 4. Polygon Containment Detection

Polygon $`P_{inner}`$ is **contained within** polygon $`P_{outer}`$ if all vertices of $`P_{inner}`$ lie inside $`P_{outer}`$:

```math
\text{contains}(P_{outer}, P_{inner}) = \bigwedge_{i=0}^{m-1} \text{point\_in\_polygon}(P_{inner}[i], P_{outer})
```

where $m$ is the number of vertices in $`P_{inner}`$.

### 4.1 Area Ratio Filtering

To prevent false positives from nearly-identical polygons (due to numerical precision), an **area ratio test** is applied:

```math
r = \frac{A(P_{inner})}{A(P_{outer})}
```

If $r > 0.99$, the polygons are considered identical and containment is rejected:

```math
\text{valid\_containment} = \text{all\_points\_inside} \land (r \leq 0.99)
```

## 5. Containment Graph Construction

Given $n$ polygons, we build a **containment graph** where an edge from $i$ to $j$ means polygon $i$ contains polygon $j$. This is computed by testing all pairs:

```
function build_containment_graph(polygons):
    n = length(polygons)
    containment = [[] for i in range(n)]
    
    for i = 0 to n-1:
        for j = 0 to n-1:
            if i ≠ j and polygon_contains_polygon(polygons[i], polygons[j]):
                containment[i].append(j)
    
    return containment
```

---

## 6. Direct Containment and Hole Detection

A polygon $`P_j`$ is a **direct child** (immediate hole) of $`P_i`$ if $`P_i`$ contains $`P_j`$ with no intermediate polygon between them.

Since containment is transitive (if $A$ contains $B$ and $B$ contains $C$, then $A$ contains $C$), we filter out indirect relationships:

```
function find_direct_children(containment):
    n = length(containment)
    direct_children = [[] for i in range(n)]
    
    for i = 0 to n-1:
        for j in containment[i]:
            if is_direct_containment(i, j, containment):
                direct_children[i].append(j)
    
    return direct_children

function is_direct_containment(outer, inner, containment):
    for k in containment[outer]:
        if k ≠ inner and inner in containment[k]:
            return false  # Found intermediate polygon
    return true
```

---

## 7. Zone Classification

Based on the number of direct children (holes), polygons are classified:

| Direct Children | Zone Type | Description |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| 0 | **Simple Zone** | Solid region with no holes |
| 1 | **Ring Zone** | Annular region (1 outer, 1 inner boundary) |
| ≥2 | **Multi-Hole Zone** | Region with multiple holes |

---

## 8. Area Calculation

**Ring Zone:** $`A_{ring} = A(P_{outer}) - A(P_{inner})`$

**Multi-Hole Zone:** $`A_{multi} = A(P_{outer}) - \sum_{i=1}^{k} A(H_i)`$ where $k$ is the number of holes.
